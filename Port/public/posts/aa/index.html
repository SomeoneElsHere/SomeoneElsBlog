    <p><p>This project was done some years ago, but is still pretty cool.</p>
<p>It is part of the AAO case maker, and goes over a simple trial I made a couple years ago. It&rsquo;s not very good, but it showcases some basic logic I was able to achieve with the service.</p>
<p>Currently, the website is down, so uh&hellip; wait till it&rsquo;s up, I guess?</p>
