    <h2>Java Server</h2>
    <h1>2025-09-01 09:41:07 -0500 CDT</h1>
    <p><p>This is a simple server thing that I created a while back. To use, you&rsquo;ll have to edit the CLIENT.java file.</p>
<p>First, you want to have the Server file on one PC and the Client file on another (The RUN files are for testing). Both computers need to be on the same Wi-Fi. Change the Client file&rsquo;s string (&ldquo;RANDO_D&rdquo;) on line 34 to be the name of the computer with the Server file. Run both files on their separate computers, and any text you type in the Client will be shown on the Server.</p>
