This project was done some years ago, but is still pretty cool.

It is part of the AAO case maker, and goes over a simple trial I made a couple years ago. It's not very good, but it showcases some basic logic I was able to achieve with the service.

Currently, the website is down, so uh... wait till it's up, I guess?
