This is a simple alarm I made with Automate; a cool app on Android that allows you to make scripts using a block coding language. The cool thing about this alarm is that, unlike other system alarms that automatically shut off if you don't wake up in time, this one won't. To shut it off you have to select the flow and stop the program. The buttons only give you some extra minutes. To use, download it and then import it on the home screen of Automate.
